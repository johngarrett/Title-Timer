# â‘‰ Title Timer

An open source project to help you keep track of your time spent on projects, tasks, etc.

## Purpose

My use case is tracking hours for timesheets. Before getting to work I start a timer then pause it whenever I take breaks. At the end of the day, I record my time and reset the timers. 

## General Notes

- For performance reasons, a timer doesn't run as a background process. When you pause the timer, the overall time is calculated and displayed. This way is more accurate and efficient. 

- Timer names are saved into `UserDeaults` and retrieved whenever the program starts. However, if you quit the program, timer states are not saved.

- OS X 10.11 or higher is required
